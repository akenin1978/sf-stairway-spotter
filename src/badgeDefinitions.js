// All badge definitions live here as static, curated content -- same
// pattern as the rating-color legend elsewhere in the app. This is not
// a database table on purpose: the badge list is fixed content Ali
// finalizes and edits deliberately, not something that needs changing
// without a deploy.
//
// Each badge has a stable `id` -- this is what actually gets stored in
// the badges_earned table, so once a badge has been awarded to anyone,
// its id should never change (the display name/description can change
// freely, the id is the permanent identity).
